# Ragnaros

2 Tanks (Fire Resistance)

## Summary
* Tanks rotate as they are knocked back. 
* Ranged spreads out 10 yards apart to avoid chaining Hammer of Ragnaros (ranged knockback).
* Melee runs out every 25s to avoid Wrath of Ragnaros (melee knockback).
* At 3 minutes, he will submerge, stack up the adds out of caster range and aoe down. 

## Dispel
* Gehennas's curse (curse) - Tank prio - reduces healing taken.

## Buffs
* Fire resistance

## Note
* All damage from ragnaros is fire based, so armor is pointless. Tanks must maximize resistance and health.
* Ragnaros will return from submerge after a 90s or as soon as all the adds are killed.
* Ranged dps cannot pull aggro due to ragnaros immobility.
