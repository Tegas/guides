# Majordomo

3 Tanks
3+ hunters
3+ mages

## Summary
* 2 tanks rotate Majordomo to keep him positioned near the center of room.
* Hunters kite Elites to Rags room, feign to send back to raid as requested (usually the last kills)
* Mages sheep healers
* 3rd tank picks up/kills healers one at a time and then Elites.

## Buffs
* Fire resistance
* Shadow resistance

## Note
* Casters need to avoid dps/polymorphing while the White (magic reflect) shield is up.
* Melee should avoid unnecessary reflection while purple shield is up.
* Once there are only 4 adds left, they can no longer be polymorphed.
