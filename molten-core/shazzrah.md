# Shazzrah

3 Tanks

## Summary
* Arrange tanks 30+ yards apart in a triangle.
* Split raid between two of the tanks, the other tank will pull.
* When Shazzrah teleports to a tank, the non-tank raid members at that position move to the location Shazzrah just teleported from.

## Dispel
* Shazzra's Curse (curse) - Tank prio - Doubles arcane damage taken - Dispeller will need to temporarily move closer to Shazzra to dispel the tank
* Magic Grounding (magic) on boss - Requires detect magic

## Buffs
* Arcane protection

## Notes
Will cast 35 yard silence rougly every 4 arcane explosions.
