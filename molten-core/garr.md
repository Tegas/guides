# Garr

1 Main Tank
8 Off Tanks/Warlocks

## Summary
* Assign warlocks to banish adds, remaining adds must have tank assigned.
* Tank Garr in middle of room.
* Kill adds one at a time by moving them near the wall and killing them at range. When they die they explode inflicting 2k fire damage in 15 yard radius and launching targets in the air.

## Dispel
* Magma Shackles (magic) from tanks that are actively moving adds to the kill location

## Buffs
* Fire resistance
* Any other trash buffs to absorb the antimagic pulse (it dispells buffs)

## Note
* If any of the adds are too far away from Garr, they will enrage and do 4x damage.
* If Garr is below 50% health he will begin periodically exploding any remaining adds for massive damage in a 30 yard radius around the add.
